# README

Controls an LED panel attached to a raspberry pi. It uses https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/examples-api-use for the api and demo programs for the panel.

# TODO

- [ ] Add image uploading
- [ ] Remove need for clicking "update" button and save open changes -- use stimulus reflex for that
- [ ] Proper shutdown sequence -- terminate processes after rails shuts down
- [ ] Create a proper deploy script -- run as production and keep running even after terminal is closed
